## Overview

The AngularJS Feature Playground is designed to help developers understand and experiment with AngularJS features in a hands-on manner. Each feature is presented as a standalone demo with editable code snippets and live previews.

## Features

- **Two-Way Binding**: Learn how AngularJS synchronizes data between the model and the view.
- **Routing**: Explore single-page application routing with AngularJS.
- **Directives**: Create custom directives to extend HTML functionality.
- **Services and Factories**: Understand reusable logic encapsulation.
- **HTTP Requests**: Fetch data from APIs using AngularJS's `$http` service.
- **Filters**: Format and transform data in views.
- **Animations**: Add dynamic animations to your application.
- **Templates**: Work with AngularJS templates for dynamic views.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
